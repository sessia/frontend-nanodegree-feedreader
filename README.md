## Instructions

### About the app
This project includes a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, that needs to be tested.
Some test suites are included to test with Jasmin some features of the app.

### How to install
To open the app and start testing just open the index.html file.

### How to test
When you open the index.html, various tests will be performed:
1. Test to ensure that each feed has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Test to ensure that each feed has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Test to ensure that the menu element is hidden by default.
4. Test to ensure that the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
5. Test to ensure that when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
6. Test to ensure that when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.

If the test has been passed, the corrisponding text will be in green.
If the test fails, the text will be in red and there will be a description of the problem found.
